return function is used to terminate the outer loop!
"1e7" means "10 to the power 7"
call  by reference can alter the original variable value. while cal by value takes only copy of original variable value. 
pointer variable is used to take address of the variable.
array size inside main function if declared integer it can carry size of 1e6
array size if globally declared ar[1e8] .it can carry size of 1e8
if array declared globally it automatically takes garbage values as 0 (if not initialised).
ASCCI value foe 'a'=97 'A'=65;
In TIME COMPLEXITY NxN is bigger value than N+N.  2N,3N Can be ignored 
it is represented as O(NxN) or O(N+N) OR O(N) or Biga of NxN.
for storing and fetching TIME COMPLEXITY of MAP takes log(n) where n is the number of elements in map. (map<int,int> mppp;)
If we use map<key,value> then key can be anything it can be pair, double,int, anything. BUT
In Unordered mapping key can only have individual data type!(you cant use pair<int,int>).
v.insert(v.begin()+2,1,3);//it inserts "3" 1 time
v.erase(start,end)
    sort(v.begin(),v.end(),greater<int>());
in vectors,lists----> v.push_front(5) or v.push_back(5) can be used.
/it creates like a dictionary in python it maps (key,value) in map. mpp[key]=value.
    map<char,int>hash; used to store the frequency
